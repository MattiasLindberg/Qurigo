# Qurigo

Qurigo is a quantum circuit simulator that execute on a classical computer.
Quantum circuits are programmed using OpenQASM 3.0 and are executed using 
the class QurigoSimulator, located in the namespace Qurigo.Simulator project.

Qurigo is written in C# and uses Numpy to perform vector and matrix operations.

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor thesis in Physics at 
Stockholm University.
